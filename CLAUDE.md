# CLAUDE.md — Standing Instructions for TolTransform

This file is read automatically by Claude Code at the start of every session in this repo. Its job is to make sure no session starts from zero — the design has already been thought through in detail; your job is to implement it faithfully, not re-derive it.

## Before doing anything else

1. **Read `docs/design_spec.md` in full.** This is the authoritative design specification, not just a plan — it contains locked architectural decisions, exact module-by-module task breakdowns, interface contracts, and a full changelog of why things are the way they are. Section 6 is the most important section for implementation work: every module has its own subsection with a granular, ordered task list, explicit deliverables, and a depends-on/used-by/public-API interface contract.
2. **Activate the virtual environment before running any Python command:**
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux — NOTE: venv is at .venv/, NOT venv/
   ```
   If `.venv/` doesn't exist yet (e.g., fresh clone), create it first: `python3 -m venv .venv`, activate, then `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Check `docs/design_spec.md` Section 11 (Changelog) for the most recent entries** before starting work, in case a decision changed since your last session.

## Non-negotiable conventions (do not silently deviate from these)

These are locked decisions from the design spec. If you think one of them is wrong, say so and ask — do not just implement something different.

- **Small-angle approximation only.** No large-angle rotation handling anywhere in the tolerance/perturbation model (Section 1.2, 2.2).
- **Perturbation convention: local-frame, right-multiplication** — `T_perturbed = T_nominal @ T_delta(delta)` (Section 2.2.2). This must match the adjoint convention used in `core/frame_graph.py`'s sensitivity primitives exactly.
- **No correlated tolerances.** Every DoF and every edge is sampled independently. Do not add covariance/correlation modeling without an explicit new discussion (Section 1.2).
- **FK chains are strictly serial/open — no closed loops, no parallel mechanisms.** `FrameGraph.validate_dag()` enforces at most one incoming edge per Frame (Section 2.3).
- **Disjoint graph components are never silently auto-connected.** If two Frames have no path between them, raise `DisjointFramesError` with the exact locked message text in Section 2.3.1/6.3 — never fabricate a connection.
- **Euler convention: intrinsic ZYX.** Documented in `core/conversions.py`.
- **`TrialData` stores full 4x4 poses per Frame per trial**, not reduced 6-vectors (Section 6, top-level note).
- **Rotation-vector convention: ω = θu**, used consistently between `postprocess/stats.py` and `postprocess/bounding_shapes.py`. `fit_rotation_cone()`/`fit_rotation_box()` must never accept raw `(N,4,4)` pose arrays.
- **The cone is the lead representation for angular error**; the per-axis box is a secondary/expandable cross-check, not co-equal.
- **`adjoint()` and `compute_sensitivity()` live in `core/frame_graph.py` — nowhere else.** Both `sim/allocation.py` and `postprocess/stats.py` consume this single shared implementation. Do not write a second copy.
- **`locked` on a tolerance does not mean zero error.** A locked DoF is still sampled in FK mode — `locked` only excludes it from the free-variable set in inverse allocation (Section 6.2/6.7).
- **GUI code talks only to `io.schema` models, never directly to `core`/`sim` objects** (Section 5.3). This rule applies starting Milestone C — not relevant yet in Milestones A/B-1/B-2.

## Milestone discipline

Build order is **A → B-1 → B-2 → C**, per Section 7. Each phase has explicit exit criteria:

- **Milestone A** must be fully complete, tested, and hand-verified before B-1 starts.
- **Milestone B-1 is not done until all three Section 9.1 physical validation benchmarks pass**: the Linear Stack-Up (RSS) Benchmark, the Sine-Bar Lever Arm Benchmark, and the Common-Ancestor Cancellation Benchmark. Do not start B-2 (the inverse allocator) before these pass — this gating is intentional, not a suggestion.
- **Milestone C (GUI) does not start until A, B-1, and B-2 are all complete and tested.**

If asked to jump ahead of this order, flag it rather than silently complying.

## Repository

This repo's remote is **https://github.com/JosephLitjens/toltransform**. Confirm `git remote -v` points here before pushing if you're ever unsure.

- **Commit after each completed task** (already stated above) **and push to `origin` after every commit** — don't let work sit unpushed across a session boundary. If a session ends (or is interrupted) before pushing, the next session should check `git status` and `git log origin/main..HEAD` first and push anything outstanding before starting new work.
- Use clear, conventional commit messages referencing the task ID from Section 7's tables where applicable, e.g. `git commit -m "A1: implement HTM class and conversions (core/transforms.py, core/conversions.py)"`.
- Do not force-push to `main`. If a mistake needs correcting, fix it forward with a new commit rather than rewriting pushed history.
- If `git push` fails (auth prompt, conflict, etc.), stop and surface the exact error to the user rather than retrying blindly or working around it — pushing is the one step that shouldn't fail silently.

## Working style

- Work through one numbered task at a time from the relevant module's Granular Task List in Section 6. Don't skip ahead to later tasks in the same module before earlier ones are done and tested.
- Every module's spec includes its own test requirements — write the tests specified, not just whatever you'd default to.
- Prefer starting a session in Plan Mode (the user can toggle this) for anything beyond a small, obvious edit — propose the approach before writing code, especially for anything touching the sensitivity/Jacobian math, the perturbation model, or the frame graph's validation logic, since these are the modules where a subtle error would be easy to miss and hard to debug later.
- Commit after each completed task (not just at the end of a module, and not in one giant end-of-session commit) so there are clean rollback points — see the Repository section below for commit/push specifics.
- If you hit an ambiguity the design spec doesn't resolve, make the simplest reasonable choice, implement it, and explicitly flag it to the user as a decision made — don't silently invent a convention. Significant decisions should be proposed as a `docs/design_spec.md` Section 11 changelog entry for the user to confirm, not made unilaterally in code with no record.

## Where things stand

*(Update this section at the end of each session so the next session — yours or a fresh one — knows exactly where to pick up.)*

- **Current milestone:** B-1 ✅ COMPLETE — all 7 tasks done. Next milestone: **B-2** (inverse allocation).
- **Last completed task:** B1-7 — Pareto sensitivity example script (commit `04b5b05`). Suite: **223 passed, 1 skipped**.
- **Next task:** B2-1 — Start `sim/allocation.py` inverse allocator (Section 6.7).

**✅ B1-7 complete (commit `04b5b05`):** `examples/pareto_sensitivity_example.py` — standalone example demonstrating all three Section 1.4 use cases: Sensitivity Pinpointing (Pareto breakdown via `compute_tolerance_sensitivities` + `to_ascii_chart()`), Component Selection (upgrade shoulder joint from ±3 mrad to ±1 mrad, compare Pareto rankings), Reporting (save frame report + 2 Pareto charts as PNG via `generate_frame_report` / `generate_sensitivity_report`). No new tests — example scripts only. **Milestone B-1 fully complete.**

**✅ B1-6 complete (commit `aacd210`):** `tests/test_physical_validation.py` — 3 module-level named regression tests:
- `test_rss_linear_stack_up`: 5-link normal-distribution translation chain; output variance matches classical RSS formula within quantified 5-SE sampling bound. 
- `test_sine_bar_lever_arm`: 1-mrad pivot + 100mm arm; `var(dy) = L²×var(rz)` within 1% rtol — validates the lever-arm cross-coupling that motivates the B-2 damping loop.
- `test_common_ancestor_cancellation`: 1m shared structural tolerance cancels completely from camera↔sample relative measurement; absolute frame confirms the shared error is non-trivially large.

**✅ B1-5 complete (commit `fda4e5c`):** `io/schema.py` (7 Pydantic v2 models + discriminated HTMInputModel union + ProjectModel cross-ref validator + frame_graph_to_project_model/project_model_to_frame_graph), `io/serializer.py` (ProjectLoadError + save_project + load_project), root `conftest.py` (importlib workaround for stdlib 'io' frozen-module conflict). 40 new tests (test_schema.py + test_serializer.py).

**✅ B1-4 complete (commit `e258538`):** `postprocess/reporting.py` — 6 public functions (plot_histogram, plot_translation_projection, plot_rotation_summary, plot_pareto_sensitivity, generate_frame_report, generate_sensitivity_report). All return Axes/Figure; callers own show()/savefig(). 2D ellipsoid projection uses covariance-slice + eigh approach. First-order caveat annotation on Pareto chart is mandatory (locked). 17 new smoke tests.

**✅ B1-3 complete (commit `fd8a08b`):** `ParetoSensitivityReport` dataclass + `compute_tolerance_sensitivities(frame_graph, frame_a, frame_b)` appended to `postprocess/stats.py`. Uses `compute_sensitivity()` from `core/frame_graph.py` (no re-implementation). Variance formula: uniform→b²/3, normal→(b/k)². `trial_data` omitted from signature (tolerance specs live on `FrameGraph` edges, not `TrialData`). 8 new tests.

**✅ B1-2 complete (commit `ef4c89c`):** `postprocess/bounding_shapes.py` — 5 public functions (fit_bounding_box, fit_bounding_sphere, fit_bounding_ellipsoid, fit_rotation_cone, fit_rotation_box). Key implementation notes: coverage=1.0 uses uniform-scale approach (scales the covariance-shape ellipsoid uniformly — guarantees enclosure); coverage<1.0 uses chi2.ppf(df=3). Both rotation functions reject (N,4,4) pose arrays. 25 new tests.

**✅ Milestone A complete — all tasks pushed to origin/main:**
- A1: `core/transforms.py` + `core/conversions.py` — `a31218e` (26 tests)
- A2: `core/tolerance.py` + `core/sampling.py` — `3ac0eed` (21 tests)
- A3: `core/frame_graph.py` — `d81645c` (24 tests); also completes B1-1
- A4: `sim/monte_carlo_fk.py` — `744c562` (18 tests)
- A5: `postprocess/stats.py` — `019eb34` (26 tests)
- A6: `tests/conftest.py` + integration tests + allocation placeholder + README — `83b8ee3` (15 tests)
- A7: `examples/single_chain_fk_example.py` + `examples/multi_chain_shared_frame_example.py` — `3d7936d`, `8232c12` (0 new tests — example scripts only)

**Two math corrections made in A3 (documented in Section 11 changelog and Section 6.3):**
- Adjoint formula: `[[R, skew(t)@R],[0,R]]` — NOT `[[R,0],[skew(t)@R,R]]`
- Sensitivity formula: `J_i = Ad_{T_{frame_a→exit_i}}` — NOT `Ad_{T_{exit→frame_b}}`

**Key facts for the B-2 session:**

**Repository state (all pushed to origin/main as of 2026-06-26):**
- `git log origin/main..HEAD` should show nothing — all B1 commits pushed (`eabd3f3` is HEAD).
- Suite: **223 passed, 1 skipped** (the skipped test is `test_allocation_mc_validation_discrepancy` in `tests/test_allocation.py` — the placeholder that B2-3 will replace with real tests).

**Files B-2 touches:**
- `sim/allocation.py` — currently a **zero-byte empty file**. This is the primary B-2 deliverable.
- `tests/test_allocation.py` — currently has 1 `pytest.mark.skip` placeholder. Replace with real tests in B2-3 (do not delete the file — add to it, then remove the placeholder once the real tests exist).

**What already exists that B-2 depends on (all implemented and tested):**
- `core/frame_graph.py`: `adjoint(T) -> np.ndarray (6,6)`, `compute_sensitivity(fg, frame_a, frame_b, edge_names) -> np.ndarray (6, 6*N)`, `path_edges_between(frame_a, frame_b) -> list[tuple[HTMEdge, bool]]` — B1-1 / commit `d81645c`. B2 calls these; does NOT re-implement them.
- `sim/monte_carlo_fk.py`: `MonteCarloFKEngine.run(fg, n_trials, seed) -> TrialData` — A4 / commit `744c562`.
- `postprocess/stats.py`: `point_pair_envelope_box(trial_data, frame_graph, frame_a, frame_b) -> dict` — A5 / commit `019eb34`. Used by `validate()` to compute achieved envelope.
- `core/tolerance.py`: `ToleranceSpec`, `ToleranceSpec6` with `.locked` flag — A2 / commit `3ac0eed`. Locked edges excluded from free-variable set in allocation only.

**One open design decision explicitly flagged in Section 6.7 Step 3:**
When `EqualAllocation.solve()` has multiple active target DoF (e.g., target specifies both dx and rx bounds), the closed-form single scale factor `s` may satisfy one but not all. The spec flags this as: "take the most restrictive/binding DoF, or solve a small least-squares system — **decide and document explicitly once this task is reached**." This is the ONE thing the spec leaves for the B-2 session to decide. Flag the choice to the user before committing to it.

**Locked constants (do not change without user discussion):**
- `gamma = 0.9` per iteration (within the spec-locked `[0.7, 0.95]` range — pick 0.9 as the default)
- `max_iter = 10`
- `n_validate = 1000` (MC trials per validation pass — deliberately low for speed)
- Non-convergence status message: **exactly** `"Allocation could not converge to target budget"`
- `AllocationResult` must preserve **both** `baseline_linear_allocation` and `corrected_allocation` — never overwrite one with the other

**B-2 task order (per Section 7.3):**
1. B2-1: `AllocationObjective` interface + `EqualAllocation` + `AllocationEngine.solve()` — closed-form linear step only
2. B2-2: `AllocationEngine.allocate()` + `AllocationResult` + `validate()` — damping loop and MC validation pass
3. B2-3: Real tests in `tests/test_allocation.py` (7 required tests per Section 6.7 Step 7)
